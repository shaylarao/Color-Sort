# Color-Sort

## Welcome to my Color Sort Program! This purpose of this project was to visualize different sorts such as bubble sort through the use of colors using Python and Python libraries.

## To see the sorts in action please look at the gifSorts directory, enjoy :)

### To run this program:
```
python colorSort.py -sort "name of sort"
```
#### For example, for bubble sort:
```
python colorSort.py -sort bubble
```
#### The outputs are .png files which are converted to a .gif files using: https://ezgif.com/maker. 
##### The gifs for the sorts are located in the "gifSorts" folder
